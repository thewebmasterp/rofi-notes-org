** Installation
Use [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/rofi-notes-org][npm]] to install ~rofi-notes-org~ globally.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ npm install -g rofi-notes-org
#+END_SRC

** Initial configuration
rofi-notes-org needs a config file located at =~/.config/rofi/rofi-notes-org.yaml= with the following properties:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  notes-file: "~/.notes_org"
  # Path to the text file where the data (notes) will be stored.

  plain-text-format: false
  # If set to true the specified `notes-file` will be in
  # plain text format rather than using Emacs Org-mode format.
#+END_SRC
At this point calling the script from the terminal should execute without errors.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ rofi-notes-org
#+END_SRC
** Usage
To use this rofi script, call it like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ rofi -show notes -modi "notes:rofi-notes-org"
#+END_SRC
You may also want to use it in a combination with other modi like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ rofi -show notes -modi "notes:rofi-notes-org,run"
#+END_SRC
You may also want to bind it to a hotkey in your window manager or desktop environment of choice.
